          "text": "Black Lives Matter disorder spread across the Atlantic with remarkable speed in 2020 after the death of George Floyd in the United States, with statues torn down or vandalised across the country and London repeatedly plunged into violent disorder, despite lockdowns.\n\nThe far-left revolutionary radicalism of the Black Lives Matter was put on full display during months of protests in Britain\u2019s multicultural capital in 2020, as Breitbart London saw first hand on the ground.\n\nOn May 31st, just five days after Floyd\u2019s death, thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets of London, in stark defiance of the city\u2019s coronavirus restrictions.\n\nAs activists gathered in Trafalgar Square, a wild-eyed activist proclaimed from a bullhorn: \u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up and get out [of] the house and f*** this place up, man. I\u2019m tired of this sh*t. We need to burn this sh*t down. I don\u2019t care what the London mayor says. The West is falling! The West is falling!\u201d\n\nWATCH: \u2018We Need to Burn This Sh*t Down\u2026 The West Is Falling!\u2019 Black Lives Matter Protest in London:\n\nKurt Zindulka\n\nThe march carried on to the United States embassy, where protesters blocked off the streets surrounding the embassy and scrawled graffiti on the walls surrounding the building saying \u2018MET POLICE SERVE TRUMP\u2019.\n\nDespite clearly violating the prohibition on mass gatherings, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police only arrested 23 people, including a woman who spat in the face of a police officer. The woman would later avoid jail time because she \u201capologised\u201d for her actions.\n\nThis would be a common feature over the summer. While Black Lives Matter protests were left largely alone by the police in London, the Met consistently cracked down \u2014 often with force \u2014 on anti-lockdown protests.\n\n#BlackLivesMatter Protesters Vandalise and Scale Abraham Lincoln Statue in London https://t.co/6Ytj0jHAcL \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 6, 2020\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart London at an anti-lockdown demonstration in December, London mayoral candidate David Kurten said there is \u201cclear bias\u201d in how the city has policed protests during the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cYou have Black Lives Matter protests with way more than six people that are allowed to go-ahead\u2026 but they come in and specifically target people who are just talking because they think we are against the lockdown and we might have opinions that may be unacceptable to those in Westminster,\u201d Kurten said.\n\nThe top police officer in the country, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, admitted in June that police took a \u2018hands-off approach\u2019 to BLM protests out of fear of sparking \u201cserious disorder\u201d.\n\nKhan\u2019s London: George Washington Statue Joins Churchill in Coffin-like Anti-BLM Box https://t.co/qdftZdlrHt \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 13, 2020\n\nThe following week, the Black Lives Matter protests in London took an even more violent turn, with protesters firing flares towards Number 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister\u2019s official residence, as well as viciously stomping an effigy of President Donald Trump into the pavement.\n\nWhile the mainstream media characterised the march as \u201clargely peaceful\u201d, some 14 officers were injured during the chaotic demonstration, with one female officer being thrown from her horse as protesters hurled glass bottles and other projectiles at the officers.\n\nThe female officer was later revealed to have suffered a collapsed lung, broken ribs, and a broken collar bone.\n\nWATCH: Trump Effigy Beaten Viciously, Police Attacked at BLM London Protest:\n\nKurt Zindulka\n\nThe same day, dozens of officers were chased through the streets by BLM radicals, throwing makeshift missiles as they yelled: \u201cRun, piggy, run!\u201d\n\nDuring the first three weeks of the BLM protests in June, some 140 Metropolitan Police Force reportedly suffered injuries. The British taxpayer spent some \u00a31.5 million in policing costs during Black Lives Matter and counter-protests on the weekend of June 13th to 14th alone.\n\n\u2018Take it to the Streets and F*ck the Police\u2019\n\nEmboldened, BLM activists increasingly gave openly anti-white and anti-British speeches in the British capital, railing against perceived racism in the United Kingdom as well as capitalism, and calling frequently to \u201cdefund the police\u201d.\n\nThe anti-white racism of some in the Black Lives Matter movement was demonstrated clearly at a June 6th rally in Parliament Square, in which one of the activist leaders urged the crowd to avoid having children with white people.\n\n\u201cDo not have a child with a white person unless you know they are willing to do the work to support that child,\u201d she said.\n\nVitriol against white people was again displayed by an activist speaker in July. The self-described \u201cmixed-race member of the LGBT community\u201d proclaimed that white people are the \u201ccommon enemy\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll of these groups of people, the issues they face, it all comes from the same people: white men. So we need to get rid of them,\u201d he said, going on to say \u201ckill the rich\u201d.\n\nWATCH: BLM Activist Says White Men Are \u2018The Common Enemy\u2019, \u2018We Need to Get Rid of Them\u2019:\n\nKurt Zindulka\n\nCapitalism itself was also a chief target for street activists in London. At a \u2018Black Trans Lives Matter\u2019 protest in June, \u2018Black Panther\u2019 Sasha Johnson said that \u201cracism only exists because of capitalism\u201d.\n\nJohnson called on the black community in Britain to \u201cstrike\u201d against white-owned businesses, saying: \u201c[We] need to cut off their money, we need to make a bigger challenge, stop paying our taxes, stop turning up to their workplace,\u201d adding that \u201cif we can strike for climate, we can strike for black lives\u201d.\n\nMs Johnson would rise to national attention after a Breitbart London video went viral in which she pronounced that \u201cThe police is no different from the KKK. They stand around and protect statues and buildings instead of people.\u201d\n\nShe went on to lead the crowd in a chant of \u201cOne Solution, Revolution\u201d and \u201cTake it to the streets and f*** the police\u201d.\n\nWATCH: BLM Activist Calls for Revolution in the UK, Saying: \u2018The Police Is No Different from the KKK\u2019:\n\nKurt Zindulka\n\nResponding to the Breitbart video, the author of The Madness of Crowds, Douglas Murray said: \u201cThey want to present this country of ours or something that it just obviously is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no reason that in the world\u2019s most\u2026 racially tolerant and mixed country, like the UK, that we should just sit by as demagogues and racists try to portray our country as some extraordinarily racist, KKK-ridden hellhole. It\u2019s not right, it\u2019s totally defamatory to our country, it\u2019s unfair, and it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Murray declared.\n\n\u201cI hope that the radical left in the UK, which has many supporters in the Labour Party among other places, remember that when they lie about this country\u2026 they ought to remember that there are people like this radicalised young woman who do seem to want to push things to the next level,\u201d he added.\n\nProtester Tries to BURN Cenotaph Flags at BLM London Demo https://t.co/OYrczjHg4o \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 8, 2020\n\nIn August, Ms Johnson would announce the formation of what she termed the \u201cthe first black-led political party in the UK\u201d, the Taking the Initiative Party (TTIP).\n\nThe party has called for \u201cHolocaust-style\u201d reparations for black people Britain as well as the formation of a \u201crace offenders\u2019 register\u201d for people \u2018guilty\u2019 of committing microaggressions against ethnic minorities.\n\nIn October, a Black Lives Matter group applied to become a political party in the United Kingdom as well.\n\nThough the official UKBLM organisation has denied any affiliation with the party, there are many BLM splinter groups within Britain, meaning that the official organisation may have been unaware of another group\u2019s intentions to form a political party.\n\n\u2018Whore, Slag, Slave Owner\u2019: Queen Victoria Statue Vandalised with \u2018BLM\u2019 Slogans https://t.co/0IEJo6UCxV \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 10, 2020\n\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage described Black Lives Matter in June as \u201ca dangerous, Marxist organisation, hell-bent on anarchy, and we need to wake up, get some facts into our heads, and understand what it is we\u2019re fighting.\u201d\n\nThe following month, as the protests raged on, Mr Farage said that the movement was becoming so radical that it \u201cwould make Lenin Blush\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is about all-out Marxism. It\u2019s about the destruction of capitalism. It\u2019s about getting rid of the nation-state as we know it. Of course, it\u2019s about defunding the police,\u201d Mr Farage said.\n\nWATCH: \u2018Take It To The Streets And F*ck The British Police\u2019 Says Black Panther Sasha Johnson:\n\nKurt Zindulka",

          "text": "Britain left the European Union in name in January 2020, but remained subject to the EU, its judges, and its migration regime through a so-called \u201ctransition\u201d period. It left in a real sense on at 11 pm on December 31st \u2014 according to supporters of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s exit deal, at least. But how did the country get here?\n\nThis is part three of a three-part series. Read part one here and part two here.\n\nWith the fall of Theresa May in June 2019, Tory MPs had at last turned to the Brexiteer king over the water, Boris Johnson, to deliver them from electoral annihilation at the hands of Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.\n\nJohnson had delayed his entry into the EU referendum campaign, missed his moment when he unexpectedly won it, and hesitated to move against May when fellow Tory Brexiteers had begged him to move against her \u2014 he had even voted for May\u2019s \u201cturd\u201d deal on her third attempt to get it through Parliament, fearing, like many Brexiteers, that if he did not accept her fake Brexit then the Remain establishment in Parliament would ensure there was no Brexit at all.\n\nThe Brexit Party had now more or less gifted him the succession, however, and with it the keys to 10 Downing Street \u2014 but what could he do with his newfound \u201cpower\u201d?\n\nJohnson\u2019s administration was much less disagreeable to Tory Brexiteers than May\u2019s, but faced the same fundamental problem: the House of Commons was dominated by Remainers, who would neither agree a Brexit deal nor allow a no-deal Brexit to take place.\n\nThe Article 50 negotiating period, supposed to expire in March 2019, had already been extended twice. Johnson found he had no effective means to break the deadlock. Some alterations were made to May\u2019s deal in an effort to force Remain diehards to agree at least some form of Brexit, with the substance of the changes being the subject of fiery debate at the time but so minor that few now remember the details \u2014 they were not sufficient to convince the DUP that Northern Ireland was being sold out, at any rate.\n\nRemain MPs did not play along, however \u2014 and they did not allow Johnson to force a no-deal by running down the clock, either, with the Tony Blair-created Supreme Court overturning a move to prorogue (temporarily suspend) Parliament before the deadline in a highly dubious and possibly unconstitutional use of their powers.\n\nMPs also forced Johnson to request a third Article 50 extension, with the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, altering parliamentary procedure at will to aid them.\n\nThree times Johnson attempted to call a general election so the people could break the impasse \u2014 and three times MPs refused to grant one, fearing the verdict of an angry public on their shenanigans. Once, they would not have been able to do so, with the power to call elections being, like the power to prorogue, an executive prerogative \u2014 but David Cameron and his Lib Dem cohort Nick Clegg had made early elections conditional on two-thirds of MPs backing one.\n\nWhat Johnson\u2019s \u201cwarmed up\u201d version of Mrs May\u2019s deal did achieve was MPs\u2019 agreement that, with the country essentially without a government heading into 2020, a general election should be held.\n\nFirmly in control of British politics, it now seems unbelievable that they changed their minds on giving Johnson his election \u2014 possibly their long string of parliamentary victories and the anti-Brexit mood among street activists in multicultural London had persuaded them they were fighting from a position of strength.\n\nAll Over by Christmas? Boris Holding Calls with Eurocrats to Deliver Deal Farage Warned Is \u2018Brexit in Name Only\u2019 https://t.co/1I6nipX3sn \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 23, 2020\n\nBrexhaustion Sets In\n\nThey were wrong. Remain politicians who drank their own Kool-Aid on the question of the public having changed their minds on Brexit as a result of the years of chaos since 2016 got a rude awakening in the December 2019 snap election.\n\nJohnson, aided once again by Nigel Farage, who opted to stand Brexit Party candidates only in some constituencies, for the most part where they would be likely to take votes away from Labour rather than the Conservatives, won an 80-seat majority under the slogan \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019.\n\nDominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, and other bow ex-parliamentarians with a big name in the Westminster bubble but no name (or a bad name) among the general public passed into the footnotes of Brexit history with remarkable speed.\n\nBut what did Boris Johnson, the man who had derided the EU\u2019s \u201ccolonial\u201d demands, and now the first prime minister since Gordon Brown or arguably Tony Blair with a strong and reliable Commons majority, do with new power?\n\nStep one, apparently, was passing his amended version of the May deal.\n\nThe 40-billion-plus euro \u201cdivorce\u201d bill, and suggestions it might not be paid if the EU did not negotiate in good faith, rapidly disappeared from the public discourse. It would be paid in full.\n\nThe Northern Ireland protocol was also agreed, with the British province subordinated to Single Market rules and divided from the rest of the United Kingdom by a partial customs border. Brexit was to \u201cget done\u201d in January 2020 with the passage of this Withdrawal Agreement \u2014 except not really, as it came with a \u201ctransition\u201d period lasting right up to the end of the year.\n\nDuring this, Britain would remain subject to EU control and EU migration and trade policy in every respect \u2014 although it would no longer have a vote in the bloc\u2019s decision-making bodies \u2014 while a trade agreement would, at last, be negotiated.\n\nNevertheless, the people celebrated this not-Brexit as best they could in January, with Nigel Farage organising a mass rally at Parliament Square after Johnson\u2019s government opted not to do anything.\n\nLeavers knew they had left in name only, but they had already waited years for Brexit Day, and believed that the \u201ctransition\u201d, at least, had a definite expiry date, and that they now had a Parliament which would not attempt to pull a fast one on them.\n\nMore than anything, people simply wanted the process to be over. May\u2019s withdrawal agreement had been excoriated as a con job, but Johnson\u2019s passed largely unremarked.\n\nSimilarly, people seemed insufficiently concerned when Johnson\u2019s summer deadline for the EU to agree a trade agreement or else face no-deal came and went \u2014 their minds now increasingly preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic which emerged from China and the lockdowns which had followed it.\n\nRemainers even used the Made-in-China disaster as an opportunity to push for the transition to be extended \u2014 but on this, at least, Johnson could not be budged.\n\nAs the weeks and months went by, however, many new \u201cfinal\u201d deadlines seemed to come and go, right up until December, leaving Britons with business or other concerns in the EU with no certainty about their future.\n\nRemainers and Leaver alike were baffled. The impasse between Britain and the EU had remained fairly constant: the EU wanted Britain to submit to its regulations and state aid rules essentially in perpetuity, via what it called a \u201clevel playing field\u201d, as well as a guarantee that Britain would not escape to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nMost controversially, Brussels demanded that the EU\u2019s control over Britain\u2019s fishing waters should continue, as they had long awarded the majority of the fisheries there to European fleets which had come to depend on them.\n\nJohnson, for his part, had always insisted Britain would not compromise on controlling its own laws and its own territorial waters. The \u201cred lines\u201d of the two sides left no room for compromise.\n\nAt least, that was the case right up until Christmas Eve, when a deal was produced \u2014 and Britain\u2019s red lines seemed to disappear.\n\nFishermen: Boris \u2018Bottled It\u2019, Brexit Deal \u2018A Defeat\u2019 for \u2018Sacrificed\u2019 Industry https://t.co/UMLmq053aZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 28, 2020\n\nStrung Up: Kippers\n\nJohnson had won free trade in goods \u2014 where the EU enjoys a massive advantage over the British. Similar trade in services, where the advantage is Britain\u2019s, was not covered by the deal.\n\nThe \u201clevel playing field\u201d was more or less there, as well, with Britain agreeing that the EU could move to cancel free trade if the British adopted rules not sufficiently similar to its own.\n\nThe EU had also retained the right to bid for public contracts on largely the same terms as before \u2014 terms which had seen British shipbuilding jobs and even the manufacture of the new EU-free blue British passports farmed out to Continental Europe.\n\nJohnson had also agreed that Britain, unlike, say, Norway and Iceland, would continue with more or less the current fisheries arrangements for at least five-and-a-half years, with British fishermen on their knees from decades of EU plunder receiving only a meagre increase in their quota share, phased in little by little over the course of this new \u201ctransition\u201d.\n\nClaims that full control will be returned after this period appear to be misleading, as the text of the deal refers to quotas continuing from mid-2026 \u201conwards\u201d \u2014 or else the EU is entitled to compensation.\n\nBritain had also agreed it would remain subject to the European Court of Human Rights, or else the EU can terminate swathes of the deal \u2014 meaning the country will still be subject to the whims of foreign judges.\n\nAnd, of course, the \u201cdivorce\u201d settlement was still to be paid in full, and Northern Ireland effectively separated from the rest of the United Kingdom \u2014 the EU even announced it would be posting its own officials to the province as enforcers\n\nSimilarly, Johnson allowed the EU to cut the British territory of Gibraltar out of his deal at the request of Spain, which has resulted in a last-minute side deal which will see Spain and/or an EU agency put in charge of monitoring sea and air travel.\n\nThese and other, less headline-grabbing downsides of the deal have elicited little objection, however. A tired public do indeed seem to want Brexit to be \u201cdone\u201d, and are willing to accept spin they would never have entertained from Theresa May \u2014 or are willing to believe that the humiliating concessions on Northern Ireland, fishing, and so on, are only temporary.\n\nWhether the British people will ultimately notice any difference between Johnson\u2019s Brexit and no Brexit remains to be seen. One thing he has secured is an end to the Free Movement of People \u2014 but as his government is presiding over massive increases in non-EU immigration and record levels of effectively unchecked illegal immigration, it is likely that the overall net inflow of people will continue to rise.\n\nNew trade deals with non-EU countries the EU did not previously have deals with may provide more tangible benefits \u2014 although the most lucrative, with the United States of America, may already have slipped away, as the Tories have squandered pro-Brexit Donald Trump\u2019s entire term.\n\nIt may be the case Britain ultimately finds itself fighting the same old battles, with politicians saying they can\u2019t protect this steel plant or prevent that contract from going abroad not because the EU ties their hands, but because the EU deal does.\n\nIn any event, the war is, at least notionally, over. But it was in the end marked by an exhausted, distracted, and locked down public not with a bang, but a whimper.\n\nBow Group: Leavers Pretending Boris Got a Good Deal Are Kidding Themselves https://t.co/LkegGLYPMf \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 31, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomery",

Just know,\u201d his brother Emmanuel told street protesters in a video circulating on social media, eliciting cheers from the crowd.\n\nAnother video appears to show him saying \u201cF*** the 12\u201d \u2014 a reference to American police drugs units, which, like the habit of referring to police officers as \u201cfeds\u201d, has crossed the Atlantic \u2014 and \u201cwe don\u2019t like these pigs\u201d, but such comments are absent from accounts of his statements in Ireland\u2019s mainstream press, despite quoting him at length in several articles.\n\nThe Guards have acknowledged the seeming threats, if obliquely, but seem loath to act on them, saying the situation is \u201csensitive\u201d and that they are \u201caware that emotions are running high and that the family and friends of the man who died are of course very upset\u201d.\n\nThey have also put a heavy emphasis on their concern that \u201clies\u201d are being spread about Nkencho \u2014 for example, that he has a long list of criminal convictions, which appears to be untrue. His family say he simply had \u201cserious mental illness\u201d.\n\nIrish Govt Wants to Criminalise Sharing, Retweeting 'Hate' Posts https://t.co/Um4LoSzI5y \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 20, 2020\n\n\u201cWe are aware of and are closely monitoring social media. We have concerns about escalating racial tensions,\u201d a \u201cwell-placed security source\u201d told the Irish Independent.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, there were threats being made against the garda who fired the shots. On the other side, lies are being circulated about the man who died claiming he was a criminal when he was not,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately these lies went viral and lots of right-minded people in society think the dead man was a criminal when he was not. All of these things stoke the fires of racial tension,\u201d they warned.\n\nWhile video footage online does appear to show demonstrators engaged in acts of disorder, such as attacking a public bus marooned by a street protest, pelting police vans with missiles, and leading a hostile march through a shopping centre, the authorities claim the extent of the unrest is exaggerated.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not exactly riots out there.

The governors of all four regions have all urged Suga to do so already, as cases rise.\n\n\"lf necessary, we won't hesitate to dispatch the medical staff from Self Defense Force,\" Suga added, saying the government will support medical facilities to ensure they are not overwhelmed.\n\nSuga did not say when the government would make a decision, or what restrictions could be enacted. Japan's first state of emergency, declared last spring, relatively early in the pandemic, lasted more than a month, and saw schools and non-essential businesses closed.\n\nJapanese authorities are currently limited in their powers to punish those who breach restrictions, even in a state of emergency, something Suga's government is reportedly planning to change to enable local governments to force compliance."

          "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here\n\n(CNN) The 117th Congress was sworn in Sunday ahead of a critical week in Washington that will see the balance of power in the Senate decided -- as a cadre of Republican lawmakers engage in a futile attempt to undo President-elect Joe Biden's clear Electoral College win by objecting to some states' votes.\n\nAs Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put it, \"To say the 117th Congress convenes at a challenging time would indeed be an understatement.\"\n\nHere's the week ahead:\n\nMonday, January 4\n\nThe first full day on Capitol Hill for the 117th Congress. Remember, this Congress looks a little different than the last.\n\nHouse Democrats kept control of the House in the November elections, but will now have a narrower majority after suffering a string of losses, despite projections that they would win more seats. Nancy Pelosi will keep her title as House Speaker after securing enough votes for reelection in the chamber Sunday.\n\nHouse Republicans, meanwhile, outperformed expectations and are now poised to add a significant number of GOP women to their ranks in the new Congress.\n\nIn the Senate, the balance of power won't be determined until Tuesday at the earliest.\n\nTuesday, January 5\n\nAll eyes turn to Georgia, where a pair of Senate runoff elections will determine which party controls the chamber.\n\nIf either of the incumbent Republicans -- Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue -- hold on to their seats, the party will maintain its majority control in the chamber.\n\nIf Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock both prevail, however, Democrats would gain control of the Senate thanks to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.\n\nAn average of recent Georgia polls show both races within the margin of error and way too close to call, CNN's Harry Enten writes\n\nIn the race for the full six-year term, Ossoff is at 49% to Perdue's 48%. In the special Senate election, Warnock is at 50% to Loeffler's 48%. (More on Georgia's long journey to a swing state here .)\n\nWednesday, January 6\n\n\"Wednesday, January 6, is a day fraught with meaning,\" Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democrats in anticipation of both chambers meeting to count Electoral College votes.\n\nUsually a ceremonial exercise, the process is poised to be defined by a futile bid from Congressional Republicans to deny Biden's election win.\n\nA dozen GOP senators -- a handful of whom were sworn-in today -- have announced they will vote against counting electoral votes for Biden. And at least 140 House Republicans are expected to join their Senate colleagues in the effort, according to two GOP House members.\n\nThe gambit, though, is doomed to fail and it bears repeating that the allegations driving these objections are not based in reality.\n\nThere have been no credible allegations of any issues with voting that would have impacted the election, as affirmed by dozens of judges, governors, and election officials, the Electoral College, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the US Supreme Court.\n\nThursday, January 7\n\nElectoral College deliberations could spill into the early morning hours Thursday. For every state objection, the House and Senate must each debate separately for two hours and hold a vote.\n\nThat's ultimately the only procedural outcome of the GOP's subversion spectacle. Congress will inevitably affirm Biden's victory as the Electoral College winner and the next president.\n\nBiden will take the oath of office at noon ET on January 20 and officially begin his term as President of the United States.\n\nThe event will be significantly scaled-down and Biden's inauguration committee is urging people not to travel for the event.\n\n\"Our goal is to create an inauguration that keeps people safe, honors the grand traditions of the Presidency, and showcases the Biden-Harris Administration's renewed American vision for an inclusive, equitable, and unified citizenry,\" committee CEO Tony Allen said in a statement."

          "text": "(CNN) California reported Sunday that 45,352 people newly tested positive for Covid-19, continuing a surge that has pushed hospitals and their exhausted staff to the brink.\n\nAround the United States, hospitals are racing to keep up with surges of Covid-19 patients at numbers they have not seen at any other time in the pandemic.\n\nOn Sunday, the country reported 125,544 current Covid-19 hospitalizations, setting a new record, according to the Covid Tracking Project . The number has exceeded 100,000 for more than a month.\n\nCases have skyrocketed since Thanksgiving, and impacts from Christmas and New Year's celebrations are still unfolding. As of Sunday, more than 20.4 million people have been infected with the virus in the US and at least 350,000 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe rising spread has not spared hospital staff either. At one California hospital, an outbreak possibly connected to an inflatable, air-powered costume on Christmas has sickened nearly four dozen employees.\n\nAnd health experts worry what will happen to those numbers if infections continue to spread.\n\n\"This is about total collapse of the health care system if we have another spike,\" said Dr. Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center.\n\n\"And we, in the hospital, cannot stop that. We can only react to it. It is the public that has the power to put a stop to the spread of this virus by obeying the public health guidance that have been put out.\"\n\nThe surge in cases has also limited the vaccine rollout, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said Sunday . The Trump administration has pushed responsibility for administering the shots to state and local partners, but they are stretched thin by the flood of cases.\n\n\"When you ask what went wrong, we have to understand that this virus also occurred in the midst of a surge and a lot of the local capacity to be able to vaccinate was being used for testing and responding to surges,\" Adams said.\n\n\"We have to understand that it occurred over the holidays and people in health departments and in hospitals take holiday breaks too. But the good news is that we are seeing it quickly ramp up thanks to our state partners.\"\n\nCalifornia hospitals on the brink\n\nIn California, emergency room officials said hospitals are treating an unprecedented number of coronavirus patients, including some health care workers.\n\nAt Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center, 44 employees in the emergency department tested positive for the virus between December 27 and January 1, according to Irene Chavez, senior vice president and area manager.\n\nChavez said in a separate statement that the medical center is investigating whether an inflatable, air-powered costume may have played a role in the spread.\n\n\"A staff member did appear briefly in the emergency department on Dec. 25th wearing an air-powered costume,\" Chavez said. \"Any exposure, if it occurred, would have been completely innocent, and quite accidental, as the individual had no Covid symptoms and only sought to lift the spirits of those around them during what is a very stressful time.\"\n\nChavez said in the statement that air-powered costumes will no longer be allowed at the facility.\n\n\"If anything, this should serve as a very real reminder that the virus is widespread, and often without symptoms, and we must all be vigilant,\" she said.\n\nIn Southern California, design and construction experts from the US Army Corps of Engineers have been deployed to the Los Angeles area to \"evaluate and where necessary upgrade oxygen delivery systems\" at about a half dozen hospitals.\n\nOne area hospital converted administrative offices and break rooms into treatment areas for their coronavirus patients, said Col. Julie Balten, commander of the Los Angeles District for the Corps of Engineers.\n\nVaccines being administered slower than expected\n\nJUST WATCHED Rollout issues dampen Covid-19 vaccine optimism Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rollout issues dampen Covid-19 vaccine optimism 02:02\n\nFederal government officials said they planned to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020, but the results so far have fallen well short.\n\nMore than 13 million vaccine doses have been distributed by the federal government to states and local counties, the CDC Covid Data Tracker said. Of those, more than 4.2 million vaccine doses have been administered. Those include doses of both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday the United States has fallen behind on administering vaccines but hopes momentum will pick up in the first few weeks of January.\n\n\"But if you look at the last 72 hours, there's been about 1.5 million administered into people's arms, which is an average of about 500,000 a day,\" he said.\n\nFauci said that the US is not where it wants to be in administering vaccines.\n\n\"We've got to do much better,\" he said.\n\nDr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner, told CNN the federal government needs to take a more active role in the mass vaccination efforts.\n\n\"The problem is local and state health departments have been doing everything else in this response. They've been the ones figuring out how to ramp up testing and contact tracing and doing public education, and now we want them to also take on the duties of launching this massive vaccination campaign. They really need the assistance of the federal government,\" she said.\n\nSo far, the vaccines approved in the US require two doses based a few weeks apart -- and the US will keep doing it that way, rather than follow the UK's decision to potentially delay second doses , Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Friday.\n\nThe UK adopted that strategy in order to give as many people as possible the first dose as quickly as possible, saying that it affords some amount of protection.\n\n\"We make decisions based on data. We don't have any data of giving a single dose and waiting for more than the normal period of time\" to give the second dose, Fauci said."

He had his 10th career 30-point half to help the Warriors take a 66-54 at the break.\n\nOne small blemish in his brilliant night: Curry had his streak of free throws snapped at a franchise-record 80 in the first.

Portland shot 14 of 43 on 3s Sunday.\n\nCurry did it all on the other end. When he sat down for good in the waning seconds and received hugs from teammates, the piped in crowd noise seemed extra loud in an arena devoid of real fans.\n\nDraymond Green had eight assists and scored one point playing his second game of the season with his minutes increased from just below 18 to 28. Green is still finding his wind. His return Friday marked his first game since Feb. 27 against the Lakers and a stretch of 309 days.

          "text": "Houston coach Kelvin Sampson spent a lot of time at halftime talking to his team about rebounding and being aggressive. The No. 5 Cougars responded.\n\n\"The second half, I just liked our execution, I liked the ball movement and I liked our rebounding,\" Sampson said. \"We looked like a Houston basketball team.\"\n\nQuentin Grimes hit a go-ahead 3-pointer to ignite a 10-0 run to start the second half, and the Cougars rebounded from their first loss with a 74-60 victory over previously undefeated SMU on Sunday night.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe Cougars (8-1, 3-1 American) had 28 of their 45 rebounds after halftime, with 11 offensive boards and 15 second-chance points after the break. Justin Gorham had 13 of his 19 rebounds in that span.\n\n\"One of the hallmarks of this team is you stay on the attack, especially on the road,\" Sampson said. \"We scored 21 points (overall) on second-chance points. That's who we are.\"\n\nSMU coach Tim Jankovich said he was disappointed after spending so much time before the game emphasizing to his Mustangs (6-1, 2-1) how well Houston rebounded.\n\n\"That\u2019s the reason we lost. It wasn\u2019t for no other reason,\" said Kendric Davis, SMU's top scorer with 23 points. \"We guarded the first shot great. They just got too many offensive rebounds.\"\n\nThat 3-pointer by Grimes from the top of the key to put Houston ahead to stay on the first shot after halftime and Justin Gorham then made a 3. Grimes also had a layup and two free throws in that game-turning run in just over 2 1/2 minutes.\n\nMarcus Sasser led Houston with 17 points. DeJon Jarreau scored 15 points, while Gorham and Grimes had 11 points.\n\nFeron Hunt had 12 points and 12 rebounds for SMU, and Ethan Chargois scored 10 points.\n\nGrimes, Houston\u2019s leading scorer at 18.5 points a game and second in the AAC only to Davis\u2019 19.2 coming in, was scoreless with only one shot before halftime, when he played only eight minutes after two early fouls.\n\nNIFTY ASSISTS\n\nSMU had its largest lead after Chargois followed his missed 3-pointer with assists on back-to-back baskets that made it 30-25 with 2:39 left in the first half, though they led by only one at the break.\n\nHunt rebounded the missed 3, got the ball back to Chargois up top for his quick pass to Davis, who hit a tiebreaking 3. Chargois then had a steal, but instead of going all the way to score, he did an underhand scoop to bank the ball off the backboard to Hunt for an emphatic dunk.\n\nTHINGS GOT TESTY\n\nYor Anei, the transfer forward from Oklahoma State playing only his third game for SMU, had a bad pass with about 3 1/2 minutes left in the first half. Jamal Shead stole the ball and fed an alley-oop pass to Gorham, but he was fouled hard by Anei when going up for the shot. The two big men were tangled up after coming down hard on the floor. Jarreau elbowed Anei after he got up, and there was some other shoves. Jarreau and SMU\u2019s Darius McNeill were both assessed technical fouls.\n\nMISSING MILLS\n\nHouston sophomore guard Caleb Mills has stepped away from the program for personal reasons. Mills had been limited to four games because of COVID-19 and an ankle injury. Asked if Mills would play again this season, Sampson said he didn't know.\n\n\"I care more about Caleb than I do whether he plays or not. ... That\u2019s irrelevant to me in the big picture. I want him to be comfortable,\" the coach said. \"Between COVID and his injuries, he\u2019s just had a lot of stuff going on.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nHouston: The Cougars are one-tenth of a second from still being undefeated. They lost Tuesday night on the road when Tulsa made two free throws with 0.1 left.\n\nSMU: The Mustangs had been 4-0 at home this season, and had won 19 of their previous 21 at Moody Coliseum.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWhen the Cougars moved up to No. 5 last week, it was their highest ranking since the Phi Slama Jama days with Hakeem Olajuwon when they were No. 5 in the final poll of 1983-84, the same season they lost to Georgetown in the national championship game. With three Top 10 teams losing games Saturday, including No. 3 Kansas, Houston may not fall too far \u2014 if at all \u2014 after coming back with a win over an SMU team that had been undefeated.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHouston plays five of its next six games at home, starting Wednesday night against Wichita State.\n\nSMU plays the second of three home games in a row Thursday against Cincinnati."

The results of the 2020 race are expected to be certified by Congress during a session on Wednesday despite efforts by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies in the House and the Senate, who have said they will challenge the results in several states, including Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump said he hoped Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s office could address his claimed discrepancies before Tuesday\u2019s Senate runoff election in Georgia, one that will decide the balance of power in the Senate. The president is slated to campaign on Monday night in Georgia for the two Republican incumbents, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.\n\n\u201cI think we should come to a resolution of this before the election,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Otherwise, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have people just not voting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hate the state. They hate the governor and they hate the secretary of state.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you\u2019ve recalculated.\u201d\n\nMr. Raffensperger politely but firmly rejected the president\u2019s entreaties, standing by the election results in his state and repeatedly insisting that Mr. Trump and his allies had been given false information about voter fraud.\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nLegal experts said Mr. Trump might have violated Georgia state laws against solicitation of voter fraud and extortion by seeking to exert pressure on Mr. Raffensperger."

But prosecuting a federal crime is obviously a very different thing.\u201d\n\nDavid Worley, a Democrat and a supporter of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is a member of the State Election Board in Georgia, wrote Sunday evening to Mr. Raffensperger and other members of the board asking the secretary of state, who is the board chairman, to open an investigation into the phone call to see if it violated state law, including a provision prohibiting conspiracy to commit election fraud.\n\nIf the board concludes a law has been broken, Mr. Worley said, it could ask state law enforcement authorities to consider filing criminal charges or a civil case against Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cTo say that I am troubled by President Trump\u2019s attempt to manipulate the votes of Georgians would be an understatement,\u201d Mr. Worley, who is the sole Democrat on the five-member board, wrote in the email. \u201cOnce we have received your investigative report, it will be the board\u2019s duty to determine whether probable cause exists to refer this matter.\u201d\n\nState officials in Georgia might also face a challenge in bringing a case against a federal official, or even a former federal official, said Ms. Webster and Ryan C.

The bargain delivered him a personal legacy of 234 conservative judges along with business-friendly federal policies prized by Republicans. Mr. McConnell even delayed the traditional recognition of the presidential winner \u2014 a man he has known for decades and considers a friend \u2014 to mollify Mr. Trump until it became untenable with the initial tally of electoral votes on Dec. 14.\n\nIt was still not enough for Mr. Trump, who made clear that he expected Republicans to join him first in sowing doubt about the election results and ultimately in moving to overturn them."

To get the vaccine across a country famous for its size and its sometimes unreliable roads, officials will tap into knowledge from nationwide polio vaccination and newborn immunization campaigns, and the skill and flexibility employed in India\u2019s mammoth general elections, where ballot boxes are delivered to the furthest reaches of the country.\n\nThe Serum Institute says it is on track to increase production of the vaccine, which is known as Covishield in India. With $270 million of its own funds and $300 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Serum plans to ramp up manufacturing capacity to 100 million doses per month by February, said Mayank Sen, a company spokesman.\n\nInitially, the Serum Institute signed a pact with AstraZeneca to make one billion doses of the vaccine for low-and-middle-income countries. The vaccine holds appeal to developing countries because it is cheaper to make and easier to transport than those that require colder temperatures during storage and transportation."

          "text": "Parents face more disruption and uncertainty as local authorities across the country scramble to delay schools reopening in the face of rising coronavirus infection rates and the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, admitted that more could be shut in the coming weeks.\n\nOn the day before millions of children were set to return to their classrooms, Essex council said it would unilaterally close schools to most pupils until at least Wednesday and Kent county council joined England\u2019s largest education authority in Birmingham in asking the education secretary to allow primaries to stay closed. They said the argument for reopening amid high infection rates \u201cdoes not stack up\u201d.\n\nEducation bosses in Newcastle, Gateshead and Manchester also said they would support primary schools that decide not to fully reopen. Some primary schools in Slough have confirmed they will not reopen this week and Brighton and Hove city council has advised primary schools not to return in person, except for vulnerable or key workers\u2019 children.\n\nThe moves came as Labour called for a national lockdown within 24 hours, warning the virus was \u201cout of control\u201d. While stopping short of calling for all schools to close, the party\u2019s leader Keir Starmer, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d more would need to do so.\n\nHis comments came after Johnson warned lockdown rules were \u201cabout to get tougher\u201d and acknowledged that school closures could be part of measures to quell infections, as official figures showed another 54,990 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and a further 454 deaths.\n\nBut the prime minister also urged parents to send their children to primary schools this week: \u201cI understand people\u2019s anxieties but there is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe and that education is a priority.\u201d\n\nPrimary schoolchildren were due to return to classrooms starting on Monday in all but 60 high-infection \u201ccontingency\u201d areas, which include all of London and large areas of Essex and Kent, as well as parts of East Sussex, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire.\n\nSecondary schools are due to stay closed this week to all but vulnerable children and those with parents who are key workers. They will only reopen next week for pupils in years 11 and 13 facing GCSE and A-level exams. They are expected to reopen more fully from 18 January.\n\nHowever, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said on Sunday that reopenings would only happen \u201cin areas where we have not had to apply the contingency framework\u201d, opening the door for secondary schools in more hard-hit areas to remain shut to the majority of pupils into the second half of January.\n\nThe Department for Education is making preparations for more remote learning and said it expects to deliver more than 50,000 laptops and tablets to schools on Monday and more than 100,000 in total during the first week of term.\n\nA DfE spokesperson said: \u201cChildren\u2019s education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission. As we\u2019ve said, we will move to remote education as a last resort, with involvement of public health officials, in areas where infection and pressures on the NHS are highest.\u201d\n\nThe government was criticised for failing to deliver on a promise to deliver laptops to disadvantaged children in the first lockdown.\n\nCouncillor Garry Bridges, in charge of education at Manchester city council, stressed \u201cthe best place for children is to be in school\u201d but said the current strategy of closing schools only in the south showed \u201ca London-centred focus\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are not giving blanket advice to schools to remain closed currently but will work with individual schools to make the right decision for their circumstances and support them in any way we can,\u201d he said.\n\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, urged the government to allow \u201clocal flexibility\u201d in deciding which schools to open to most pupils and to \u201clet headteachers come to a balanced judgment based on what\u2019s happening\u201d.\n\nIan Ward, the leader of Birmingham council, and Jayne Francis, the council member for education, told Williamson in a letter: \u201cThe new strain of the virus and the rising case levels in the city mean we are deeply concerned about the return of children to primary schools, special schools and alternative provision next week.\u201d\n\nBut the government pushed back on Sunday by refusing to allow Cumbria to keep its primary schools closed. Covid infections are doubling every four to five days in parts of the county and the council asked for approval to keep its primary schools closed for a fortnight.\n\n\u201cThis is disappointing news and I feel that this is the wrong decision for Cumbria and for our families and communities,\u201d said Stewart Young, the council leader.\n\nThe TUC criticised the government\u2019s \u201clast-minute\u201d approach to schools reopening, and called on employers to offer furlough to all parents affected by closures. The organisation said it was concerned that not all bosses were aware that caring responsibilities were an acceptable reason to furlough, so many would have no choice but to take unpaid time off work to look after children, or leave jobs altogether.\n\nThe uncertainty over school openings has been fuelled by starkly competing interests. The Children\u2019s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, on Sunday issued a warning about children\u2019s mental health and said new school closures marked \u201ca serious moment for children\u201d. She said any closures must be for \u201cthe absolute minimum of time\u201d and called for teachers to be vaccinated \u201cas a priority\u201d.\n\nHowever, on 22 December the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) group concluded \u201cR [the reproduction number for the virus] would be lower with schools closed\u201d. It said the biggest effect would be if secondary schools were shut. The Independent Sage group of experts last week called for the closure of schools for at least a month for most children.\n\nAll four of England\u2019s main teaching unions, including the National Education Union (NEU), the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Association of Head Teachers, have called for schools to remain closed to all but eligible pupils. The move is also backed by Unison and GMB, representing the majority of other school staff.\n\n\u201cIt is not good enough to always be behind the curve, playing catch up with new strains of Covid, seeing hospital admissions rise and cases numbers spiral out of control,\u201d said Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU.\n\nThe government has also been called upon to urgently rethink its approach to exams. Speaking on Sunday, Johnson suggested for the first time that A-levels and GCSEs may not take place in England this summer, telling Marr: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be realistic about the pace of which this new variant has spread \u2026 and we\u2019ve got to be humble in the face of this virus.\u201d"

Just over half of these children are \u2018invisible\u2019 to services,\u201d said Anna Alcock, the head of engagement and advocacy at UK Youth. \u201cYouth work could be the only answer to helping these children; a preventative service that provides support before problems arise.\u201d\n\nThe preliminary data, which will be at the centre of a more in-depth report published later this year, is in line with recent research by the National Youth Agency (NYA) which found many youth charities are \u201crunning on empty\u201d.\n\n\u201cYouth services simply do not have the capacity or enough funding to meet young people\u2019s vastly increased needs,\u201d said the NYA\u2019s chief executive, Leigh Middleton. \u201cThey have depleted reserves and incomes slashed by half or more.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for greater investment in frontline youth services right now, sustained throughout any lockdown and regional tier emergency measures.\u201d\n\nAnne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, said the research was \u201cshocking but sadly, not surprising\u201d.\n\n\u201cA major funder said to me recently that he had wanted to substantially invest in youth provision but when he had sought applications, he found most of the services he wanted to support had already closed down,\u201d she said.\n\nAreas suffering the most significant cuts in spending on young people have recorded larger increases in knife crime and drug-related crimes, said Longfield.\n\n\u201cYouth services are the last line of defence for vulnerable children,\u201d she said. \u201cIf these children have a bad time at home and don\u2019t have the structure of school, for whatever reason, and then you take away youth services too, they\u2019re completely on their own, with nothing protecting them from physical abuse, self-harm and drug use, being exploited and groomed.\u201d\n\nTom Madders, the director of campaigns at YoungMinds, said: \u201cFor lots of young people, youth clubs are a lifeline. Without early support for their mental health, young people\u2019s needs often escalate, sometimes resulting in crisis and more acute intervention.\u201d\n\nJust over \u00a334m of the emergency \u00a3750m coronavirus fund for charities was directed to children and youth charities. The government\u2019s \u00a3500m youth investment fund to help transform and increase capacity of the youth sector, confirmed in the Conservative manifesto in December 2019 and due to start in April 2020, has yet to be spent.\n\nIn addition, the government has delayed its review of the statutory duty for local authorities to secure local youth services until summer 2021 and has suspended reporting by local authorities on funding of youth services until 2022.\n\nMatthew Hussey, the public affairs manager of the Children\u2019s Society, said another missed opportunity was the chancellor\u2019s spending review in December.\n\n\u201cIt was a chance to place children\u2019s services, which include council-led support for young people like youth work, on a sustainable footing and give councils the resources they need to rebuild the support so needed by children and young people,\u201d he said.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on young people, which is why we recently announced a \u00a316.5m fund for the youth sector and have provided more than \u00a360m to children\u2019s and youth organisations as part of a wider multibillion-pound support package for charities.\u201d\n\nBut the NYA said that referring to a range of different funding pots and commitments to youth work \u201csimply disguises the paucity of funding specific to the youth sector\u201d and the limited ways funding can be used: the \u00a316.5m, for example, can only be claimed against revenue/losses from the second national lockdown\u201d.\n\nMiddleton said: \u201cThe government response confuses the picture by referencing general funding \u2018for young people\u2019.\u201d\n\nCollapse of youth services\n\nThere has been a 71% cut in spending on children and youth services across England in less than a decade.\n\nOver the same period, local authority spending on crisis intervention services for children and young people has risen from \u00a35.6bn to \u00a37.2bn \u2013 a 29% increase.\n\nAt the start of the decade, crisis intervention accounted for 58% of local authority spending on children and young people\u2019s services. This had risen to 78% by 2018 to 2019.\n\nThere is a north-south divide: between 2010-11 and 2018-19, spending in the north of England fell three times as fast as in the south: -9% compared with -3%.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "text": "In an hour-long phone call on Saturday, Donald Trump pressed Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory there in the election the president refuses to concede.\n\nHealthcare to the electoral college: seven ways 2020 left America exposed | Robert Reich Read more\n\nThe Washington Post obtained a tape of the \u201cextraordinary\u201d conversation, which Trump acknowledged on Twitter.\n\nAmid widespread outrage including calls for a second impeachment, Bob Bauer, a senior Biden adviser, said: \u201cWe now have irrefutable proof of a president pressuring and threatening an official of his own party to get him to rescind a state\u2019s lawful, certified vote count and fabricate another in its place.\u201d\n\nThe Post published the full call.\n\n\u201cThe people of Georgia are angry, the people in the country are angry,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you\u2019ve recalculated.\u201d\n\nRaffensperger is a Republican who has become a b\u00eate noire among Trump supporters for repeatedly saying Biden\u2019s win in his state was fair. In one of a number of parries, he said: \u201cWell, Mr President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.\u201d\n\nTrump said: \u201cSo look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cThere\u2019s no way I lost Georgia. There\u2019s no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s contempt for democracy is laid bare. Once again. On tape Adam Schiff\n\nTrump did not win Georgia, which went Democratic for the first time since 1992. Its result has been certified. Attempts to pressure Republicans in other battleground states have failed, as have the vast majority of challenges to results in court.\n\nDespite promised objections from at least 12 senators and a majority of House Republicans, Biden\u2019s electoral college victory will be ratified by Congress on Wednesday and the Democrat will be inaugurated as the 46th president on 20 January. Trump will then leave the White House \u2013 where he remained, tweeting angrily, all weekend.\n\nEdward B Foley, an Ohio State law professor, told the Post the call was \u201c\u2018inappropriate and contemptible\u2019 and should prompt moral outrage\u201d. In an email to the Guardian, University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said Trump might be \u201cin legal jeopardy after Biden is inaugurated\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor example, if the justice department or US attorneys believe that Trump violated federal law or if local prosecutors in states, such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump may have engaged in similar behaviour with state or local election officials, believe that Trump violated state election laws, the federal or state prosecutors could file suit against Trump.\u201d\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, went further, calling for Trump to be impeached a second time, little more than two weeks before he leaves office.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States has been caught on tape trying to rig a presidential election,\u201d Bookbinder said. \u201cThis is a low point in American history and unquestionably impeachable conduct. It is incontrovertible and devastating.\n\n'Integrity still matters': the unlikely Republican standing up to Trump's voter fraud lies Read more\n\n\u201cWhen the Senate acquitted President Trump for abusing his powers to try to get himself re-elected [in February 2020, regarding approaches to Ukraine for dirt on Biden], we worried that he would grow more brazen in his attempts to wrongly and illegally keep himself in power. He has \u2026 Congress must act immediately.\u201d\n\nDemocratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, said in a statement that Trump \u201cremains profoundly unfit for office\u201d and \u201cmay have also subjected himself to additional criminal liability\u201d.\n\nIn a tweet, Adam Schiff, the lead prosecutor at the impeachment trial, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s contempt for democracy is laid bare. Once again. On tape. Pressuring an election official to \u2018find\u2019 the votes so he can win is potentially criminal, and another flagrant abuse of power by a corrupt man who would be a despot, if we allowed him. We will not.\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi, the California Democrat elected House speaker for a fourth term, set out strategy for the election certification in a memo to colleagues.\n\n\u201cOver the years,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe have experienced many challenges in the House, but no situation matches the Trump presidency and the Trump disrespect for the will of the people.\u201d\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, took a shot at Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican leading calls for an \u201cemergency audit\u201d of the election.\n\n\u201cYou want to investigate election fraud?\u201d the New Yorker tweeted. \u201cStart with this.\u201d\n\nAdam Kinzinger, a Republican congressman from Illinois, tweeted: \u201cThis is absolutely appalling. To every member of Congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot \u2013 in light of this \u2013 do so with a clean conscience.\u201d\n\nStacey Abrams is laughing about you. She\u2019s going around saying, \u2018These guys are dumber than a rock\u2019 Donald Trump\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Cleta Mitchell, a Republican lawyer, were also on the call, during which Trump ran through debunked claims regarding supposed electoral fraud and called Raffensperger a \u201cchild\u201d, \u201ceither dishonest or incompetent\u201d and a \u201cschmuck\u201d. Characteristically, he also threatened legal action.\n\n\u201cYou know what they did and you\u2019re not reporting it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a criminal offence. And you know, you can\u2019t let that happen. That\u2019s a big risk to you and to Ryan [Germany], your lawyer. That\u2019s a big risk.\u201d\n\nReferring to runoffs on Tuesday that will decide control of the Senate, Trump said: \u201cYou know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam.\n\n\u201cBecause of what you\u2019ve done to the president, a lot of people aren\u2019t going out to vote, and a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative, because they hate what you did to the president. OK? They hate it. And they\u2019re going to vote. And you would be respected, really respected, if this can be straightened out before the election.\u201d\n\nRepublican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, seeking to beat Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, have ranged themselves behind Trump. But Georgia Republicans fear his attacks could suppress turnout as Democrats work to boost their own.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock bumps elbows with Stacey Abrams during a rally with Joe Biden in Atlanta. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nEarly voting has reached unprecedented levels and on Sunday, former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cWhat we\u2019re so excited about is that we haven\u2019t stopped reaching those voters. Millions of contacts have been made, thousands of new registrations have been held. We know that at least 100,000 people who did not vote in the general election are now voting in this election.\u201d\n\nTrump told Raffensperger: \u201cStacey Abrams is laughing about you. She\u2019s going around saying, \u2018These guys are dumber than a rock.\u2019\u201d\n\nNew Congress sworn in as Georgia runoffs loom and Trump runs amok Read more\n\nThe Democrats seized on the call.\n\n\u201cThat is a direct attack on our democracy,\u201d Ossoff said, at a rally in Savannah. \u201cIf David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler had one piece of steel in their spines, one shred of integrity, they would be out here defending Georgia voters from this kind of assault.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Warnock said: \u201cSenator Loeffler has a responsibility to speak out against the unsubstantiated claims of fraud, to defend Georgia\u2019s elections, and to put Georgia ahead of herself. She has not and never will.\u201d\n\nPerdue and Loeffler did not immediately comment.\n\nTrump told Raffensperger he knew the call wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing anywhere\u201d. The state official ended the conversation.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump said Raffensperger \u201cwas unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the \u2018ballots under table\u2019 scam, ballot destruction, out of state \u2018voters\u2019, dead voters, and more. He has no clue!\u201d\n\nTwitter duly applied a disclaimer: \u201cThis claim about election fraud is disputed.\u201d\n\nRaffensperger also responded: \u201cRespectfully, President Trump: What you\u2019re saying is not true.\u201d"

          "text": "Gerry Marsden, the lead singer of Gerry and the Pacemakers, known for hits including You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone and Ferry Cross the Mersey, has died at 78 after a short illness.\n\nHe shot to fame in the 1960s as the leader of the Merseybeat band at a time when Liverpool was the centre of the musical universe.\n\nMarsden\u2019s family said in a statement on Sunday: \u201cGerry died earlier today after a short illness in no way connected with Covid-19. His wife, daughters and grandchildren are devastated.\u201d\n\nHe went into hospital on Boxing Day after tests showed he had a serious blood infection that had travelled to his heart. His daughter Yvette Marbeck told the PA news agency: \u201cMy sister Vicky and myself have always been very, very proud of Dad \u2026 He was our hero, wonderful.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt was a very short illness and too quick to comprehend really. And his heart has taken some battering over the years. He had a triple bypass, an aortic valve replacement and ironically he also had a pacemaker.\n\n\u201cI am just devastated and heartbroken. Unfortunately, he died in hospital, which was devastating for us because we were not allowed in due to the current regulations.\u201d\n\nGerry Marsden in 2009. Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA\n\nThe Pacemakers topped the British charts in 1963 with their first three singles, How Do You Do It?, I Like It and You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone, a Rodgers and Hammerstein composition from the musical Carousel. The song became the anthem of Liverpool FC, sung from the Kop at every game. The club tweeted: \u201cIt is with such great sadness that we hear of Gerry Marsden\u2019s passing. Gerry\u2019s words will live on forever with us. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d.\n\nGerry and the Pacemakers played regularly alongside the Beatles. Both groups were part of Brian Epstein\u2019s Liverpool-based management stable.\n\nThey played together for the first time in June 1960 \u2013 when the Beatles were still the Silver Beetles \u2013 and in December that year they were contracted to play a four-month stint in Hamburg, prompting the group to give up their day jobs to become professional musicians. \u201cWe went over with the Beatles and had a good laugh,\u201d Marsden later recalled.\n\nThe group\u2019s first hit, How Do You Do It?, was first recorded by the Beatles in 1962, but rejected by them and given to Marsden\u2019s band by the producer, George Martin, becoming their first No 1 in April 1963.\n\nSir Paul McCartney paid tribute to his old friend on Twitter:\n\nMy sympathies go to his wife Pauline and family. See ya, Gerry. I\u2019ll always remember you with a smile. - Paul \u2014 Paul McCartney (@PaulMcCartney) January 3, 2021\n\nSir Ringo Starr tweeted: \u201cGod bless Jerry Marsden peace and love to all his family.\u201d He then tweeted: \u201cGerry. Gerry.\u201d\n\nThe Cavern Club, where both bands regularly played, tweeted:\n\nDevastated to hear of the passing of Gerry Marsden earlier today.\n\n\n\nThe word legend is often overused but Gerry was not only a legend, but also a very good friend of The Cavern. pic.twitter.com/74HQZP4gio \u2014 The Cavern Club (@cavernliverpool) January 3, 2021\n\nFerry Cross the Mersey was released in late 1964 and reached No 8 in the UK. In 1989, Marsden topped the charts with a new version of the song recorded with fellow Merseyside artists the Christians, Holly Johnson and McCartney in aid of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster, in which a crush of Liverpool fans at a stadium in Sheffield resulted in 96 deaths.\n\nMarsden married his wife, Pauline, in 1965 and the couple had two daughters.\n\nHis version of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone re-entered the charts in March at the start of lockdown, after he encouraged people to sing it from their doorsteps during the weekly Clap for our Carers. Captain Tom Moore topped the charts in April with his own version recorded with Michael Ball and an NHS choir to raise money for health service charities."

          "text": "But the broader picture could yet be quite grim. This past week marked the formal start of a new decade. To kick it off, Today\u2019s WorldView spotlights three trendlines that could define the years to come.\n\nChanging demographics\n\nAccording to a 2015 U.N. study, the world is expected to have a population of about 8.5 billion people in 2030 \u2014 about a 15 percent increase in the size of humanity in just 15 years. India will have surpassed China to become the world\u2019s most populous nation, while demographers forecast a pronounced population surge in sub-Saharan Africa, which will soon be home to the world\u2019s most youthful societies. The number of megacities may double by the end of the decade, with close to two-thirds of humanity living in urban centers.\n\nIn addition, by 2030, more than a billion people on the planet will be over the age of 65, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. That\u2019s due to longer life expectancies and improving living standards around the world. But the maturing of the world population \u2014 not just in the West, but throughout Asia and Latin America, too \u2014 carries real policy conundrums.\n\nEuropean governments are already grappling with a future shaped by rising costs for elder care, the consequences of declining populations and a shrinking workforce. The political solutions to these long-term challenges may include encouraging more immigration to fill jobs and weakening social protections to drive worker productivity. Demographic anxieties will almost certainly take up greater space in Western politics: On both sides of the Atlantic, far-right movements increasingly see anti-feminism as a rallying cry at a time of declining birthrates.\n\nChina\u2019s authoritarian leadership is all too aware of the need to pivot given its aging population and has set about trying to reorient the Chinese economy to cater more to a domestic market after years of export-driven boom. In a decade\u2019s time, we may also know whether India\u2019s youth glut \u2014 more than half of its population is under 25 \u2014 has turned into either a demographic boon or a curse. The world\u2019s largest democracy is already struggling to support its vast population of young people with adequate education, health care and jobs.\n\nThe deepening toll of climate change\n\n2030 represents a major milestone for the international organizations and climate scientists that have been climate change\u2019s doleful town criers. Two years ago, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that without huge, unprecedented cuts to carbon emissions over the next decade, the world would place itself on the brink of climate disaster. Subsequent studies suggested that, even if the demands of climate activists were met, it would take decades to measure any discernible effects.\n\nThere are reasons for hope. Myriad governments have embraced ambitious plans to transition their economies toward being carbon neutral. The incoming Biden administration intends to add momentum to global climate efforts abandoned by President Trump, while Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that China plans to decrease its carbon footprint to at least 65 percent of where it was in 2005 by 2030. The World Economic Forum \u2014 a bastion of optimism \u2014 foresees a future in 2030 in which urban centers are transformed into zones shaped by pedestrian activity, technology increasingly obviates the need to own cars, fewer people eat meat, people breathe cleaner air and renewable, clean energy dominates the energy sector.\n\nThat\u2019s the rosy view. The demands of a rising middle class in the developing world may prove a challenge to decarbonization efforts, while climate skepticism may further drive a host of right-wing movements in the West as their opponents go green. Rather than a warning to the world, melting ice caps in the Arctic are already opening new trade lanes and avenues for exploration, stoking a new era of geopolitical competition. All the while, scientists predict an increasing number of extreme weather events wracking the world and destabilizing vulnerable communities.\n\nThe mess of global governance\n\nThe past decade shifted our view of global politics. Long gone is any certainty in the inexorability of liberal democracy \u2014 single-party states still flourish, while demagogic populism and far-right nationalism are powerful forces within many of the world\u2019s major democracies. Rights groups warn of the erosion of once-healthy democracies and new threats to freedom and privacy posed by government cyber surveillance.\n\nVisions of a robust liberal world order have given way to white papers on the return of great-power competition. That includes the new race over research and the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, which is predicted to add some $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. China has poured vast resources into its tech sector and is arguably the global pacesetter in the development and implementation of AI technologies, an advantage that has huge political implications. \u201cWhoever leads in artificial intelligence in 2030 will rule the world till 2100,\u201d declared a recent policy briefing from the Brookings Institution.\n\nLiberals in the West hope the serious challenges of the next decade \u2014 all of which require expanded international cooperation and coordination \u2014 will eventually dispel the angry nationalism of the present."

          "text": "Prosecutors want Assange flown by U.S. marshals to Northern Virginia to face the charges, which expose him to a possible 175-year sentence in a maximum-security prison.\n\nIn a series of hearings over the past year, Assange\u2019s lawyers have argued before British Magistrate Vanessa Baraitser that the Trump administration is targeting the 49-year-old Australian for \u201cpurely political\u201d reasons.\n\nThe Assange legal team and its witnesses contend that his prosecution upends protections for journalists and publishers and that he would be denied a fair trial in a U.S. court, in part because he is a foreigner and an outspoken anti-authority figure.\n\nTo counter the extradition request, Assange\u2019s British lawyers also presented witnesses to testify that their client suffers from Asperger\u2019s syndrome, that his mental health is \u201cfragile\u201d and that he is at \u201chigh risk of suicide.\u201d\n\nMichael Kopelman, professor of neuropsychiatry at King\u2019s College London, told the court in September that Assange suffers from anxiety, depression and auditory hallucinations, that he has planned and imagined taking his own life, and that faced with imminent extradition, \u201che would indeed find a way to commit suicide.\u201d\n\nSince a gray-bearded Assange was expelled from the Ecuadoran Embassy in London in April 2019 and dragged away by British police, the anti-secrecy crusader has languished behind the gray walls of Belmarsh prison outside the capital. He has been denied bail while waiting for the extradition request to be settled.\n\nBritish legal experts say the British judge could, for example, accept the premise that the prosecution is political in nature but still find that Assange could get a fair trial at the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.\n\n\u201cThere really is no precedent for a British court to find that the American criminal justice system is incapable of giving him a fair trial,\u201d said Nick Vamos, formerly head of the extradition unit at the Crown Prosecution Service and now a partner at Peters & Peters law firm in London.\n\nVamos said British courts have blocked extradition to countries with disreputable courts, such as Russia, and others with inhumane and degrading prisons. \u201cBut there\u2019s much respect for the U.S. system,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Assange\u2019s extradition is blocked, it would probably be because the judge agrees that Assange\u2019s mental health poses too great a risk. Even here, the bar is set very high, as the U.S. prisons are filled with mentally ill inmates, and James Lewis, the lawyer representing the U.S. government, argued in court that they receive adequate care.\n\nYet there is recent precedent for denying a U.S. request on the grounds pursued by Assange.\n\nOn appeal, the British High Court in 2018 blocked the extradition of the activist Lauri Love, who was charged in 2013 with hacking into U.S. government computers to steal confidential data. Love\u2019s lawyers presented evidence that he suffered from depression and would try to take his life if extradited. U.S. prosecutors later dropped the charges.\n\nThe losing side will almost certainly appeal to the High Court to reverse the lower court\u2019s decision. That process \u2014 and a possible further appeal to Britain\u2019s Supreme Court \u2014 could take six more months.\n\nIn recent weeks, Assange supporters have urged President Trump to issue a pardon for the WikiLeaks activist.\n\nIn the Daily Mail tabloid, Stella Morris, Assange\u2019s partner and the mother of their two children, published an open appeal to Trump on Sunday.\n\nShe wrote that she had nightmares about Assange \u201cbeing buried in the deepest, darkest corner of the [U.S.] prison system for the rest of his life\u201d because he \u201cembarrassed Washington and this is their revenge.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cthe nightmares came to a sudden stop the week before Christmas, when a groundswell of support from all sides of the political spectrum called for President Trump to pardon him.\u201d\n\nMorris, who is Assange\u2019s former attorney, wrote that \u201cleading figures, from former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin to Nobel Prize winners, such as human-rights campaigner Adolfo Perez Esquivel, have been calling for Julian\u2019s freedom.\u201d\n\nTo prove that the prosecution\u2019s case is tainted by politics, one of Assange\u2019s lawyers, Jennifer Robinson, testified that she was present at an Aug. 16, 2017, meeting at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London where former congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), an ally of Trump, offered Assange a pardon from the president in exchange for saying that Russia had nothing to do with the 2016 hack and leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn a statement posted on his website last year, Rohrabacher denied the details but not the meeting.\n\nThe former congressman said he was on his \u201cown fact finding mission at personal expense\u201d and that \u201cat no time did I offer Julian Assange anything from the President because I had not spoken with the President about this issue at all.\u201d\n\nDuring the extradition hearings last year, Daniel Ellsberg, the former RAND Corporation analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971, testified that the Assange prosecution would undermine traditional protections for investigative journalists and the whistleblowers they rely upon.\n\nEllsberg told The Washington Post on Sunday that he thinks there is \u201ca small chance, but not zero\u201d that Trump will either pardon Assange or order the case to be dropped.\n\n\u201cWhy? To stick it to the intelligence community, Trump\u2019s \u2018deep state,\u2019 \u201d Ellsberg said.\n\nThe Assange affair is much different from past espionage cases. No prior case has so squarely tested the limits of the First Amendment.\n\nIn court filings and news conferences, U.S. prosecutors have sought to distinguish Assange and WikiLeaks from the mainstream press, arguing that no reporter would help a source try to break into encrypted files or expect legal protection if they did.\n\n\u201cJulian Assange is no journalist,\u201d Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said when the charges were announced. \u201cThis is made plain by the totality of his conduct as alleged in the indictment.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his alleged violations of the Espionage Act and the publishing of classified documents, U.S. prosecutors have charged Assange with conspiracy to commit \u201ccomputer intrusions\u201d by helping Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning try to hack a password.\n\nIn a superseding indictment unsealed in June, prosecutors say he also solicited hackers to break into Icelandic government computers to steal information.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which reviews cases from federal court in Alexandria, ruled in a 2013 leak case that a reporter had no First Amendment protection from testifying before a grand jury.\n\nBut no case law explains the difference between a responsible or irresponsible publisher of classified information, and press organizations have warned that Assange\u2019s prosecution sets a dangerous precedent by leaving the Department of Justice as arbiter of that line.\n\nBarry Pollack, one of Assange\u2019s American attorneys, said the evidence used to make Assange appear reckless is weaker than it seems. \u201cThe actual facts that came out at the extradition hearing are wildly different than what was portrayed in the indictment,\u201d he said.\n\nAs part of the extradition case, prosecutors indicated that they have considered the First Amendment implications of the case and possible responses, including that Assange, as an Australian citizen, is not covered by U.S. free speech protections.\n\nMark Zaid, a national security lawyer who regularly represents whistleblowers, argued that Assange is so far outside the world of journalism in his motives and behavior that his case has no implications for the mainstream press.\n\n\u201cThey are anarchists whose intent is to undermine the United States and other democracies,\u201d he said of Assange and his followers.\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon Papers decision left the door open to prosecution of reporters. Assange supporters say the charges against the WikiLeaks founder create a \u201cslippery slope\u201d that could lead to more prosecutions of journalists. Zaid said that possibility already exists.\n\n\u201cIt has been well-known for decades that the U.S. government could prosecute journalists and publishers for possessing and publishing classified information, and it has always chosen not to,\u201d he said."

          "title": "Brian Urquhart, a foundational leader at the United Nations, dies at 101",
          "text": "A principal adviser to five U.N. secretaries general, Mr. Urquhart (pronounced Er-Kut) played a central role in translating the United Nations\u2019 founding principles into action. He said his work at the U.N. was motivated by \u201cidealism of a very practical kind\u201d following his traumatic experiences in World War II.\n\nServing in the British military and intelligence, he had witnessed firsthand the slaughter perpetrated by the Nazi regime as well as the vanity of Allied military leaders whose failure to heed obvious cautions led to thousands of preventable casualties.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, as the lone official in Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold\u2019s inner circle with military experience, Mr. Urquhart helped invent the practice of U.N. peacekeeping through the establishment of the U.N. Emergency Force, which in 1956 was sent to supervise the cessation of hostilities in the Suez Canal area between Egypt and Israel.\n\nMr. Urquhart\u2019s greatest legacy was in U.N. peacekeeping, a practice that was not mentioned in the U.N. charter, but that initially involved the deployment of impartial, unarmed or lightly armed soldiers between warring parties to help monitor truces or implement peace agreements. Their blue helmets became a familiar sight in crisis zones around the world.\n\nWhile Mr. Urquhart spent much of his working life at the U.N. Secretariat in New York, he served as a leading mediator and diplomatic troubleshooter in some of the world\u2019s most truculent conflict zones, including Congo, Cyprus, Kashmir, Namibia and the Middle East.\n\n\"Sir Brian Urquhart showed that principles and politics can be blended in practical operations to help prevent and end wars,\" said Bruce Jones, a former director of the New York University Center on International Cooperation. \"That's been the core of the U.N. ever since.\"\n\nMr. Urquhart\u2019s U.N. career coincided with the soaring optimism of the immediate post-World War II years, through the growing pains of decolonization that tripled the U.N.\u2019s membership, to the paralyzing years of Cold War ideological confrontation and gridlock.\n\nIn 1957, Mr. Urquhart played a pivotal role in setting up the International Atomic Energy Agency, which he called the \u201cfirst big break in the Cold War\u201d fight over the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\nBeyond his official duties, Mr. Urquhart performed as the U.N.\u2019s unofficial house historian, defining the public\u2019s understanding of the U.N. through his acclaimed memoir, \u201cA Life in Peace and War,\u201d and extensive essays in the New York Review of Books, where he continued to write into his 90s. In 1986, he retired his self-appointed title as the \u201cU.N.\u2019s oldest inhabitant.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mr. Urquhart wrote biographies of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ralph Bunche, whom he succeeded as U.N. undersecretary general for special political affairs, and Hammarskjold, whom he considered a personal hero and a model for all secretaries general.\n\nBlunt, urbane and irreverent, Mr. Urquhart possessed an understated sense of humor that showed through even in the face of his multiple brushes with death during peacekeeping efforts. \u201cBetter beaten than eaten,\u201d the bloodied U.N. official quipped to a group of reporters in 1961, just moments after surviving a beating by Congolese secessionists in Elisabethville.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Urquhart advocated a view that U.N. peacemakers should negotiate with any influential parties, no matter how unsavory. \u201cWe don\u2019t have these moralistic hang-ups about whom we can deal with,\u201d Mr. Urquhart told the New York Times in 1981 after having negotiated with the Palestine Liberation Organization to stop firing missiles into Israel from Lebanon.\n\nMr. Urquhart was one of the only U.N. officials who was accepted by both Israel and the Palestinians as a mediator. In February 1982, a few months before Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, Mr. Urquhart was dispatched to the region on shuttle diplomacy with Prime Minister Menachem Begin \u2014 who considered Mr. Urquhart a \u201cman of valor\u201d \u2014 and PLO leader Yasser Arafat.\n\nWhile Mr. Urquhart worked around-the-clock to reach an agreement, he secured a temporary truce, but he eventually realized negotiations were fruitless. \u201cWe delivered the PLO as usual,\u201d he told the New York Times, \u201cbut Israel took advantage of the cease-fire to occupy the heights around Beirut.\u201d\n\nAs a public face of the U.N., Mr. Urquhart drew withering criticism at times. He said he grew to expect hostility from conservative ideologues with ramrod support for Israel in Middle East conflicts. \u201cWhen the United States gets into Middle East bargaining,\u201d Mr. Urquhart once wrote, \u201cthe price of all the rugs tends to go up, and the prospect of a deal becomes more distant.\u201d\n\nMr. Urquhart also became a target for having worked under Kurt Waldheim, the secretary general from 1972 to 1981 who served in the German army during World War II and was accused of participating in Nazi atrocities.\n\nIn 1988, Shirley Hazzard, an Australian-born author and former U.N. official, wrote in the New York Times that Mr. Urquhart had played \u201can essential role in presenting Mr. Waldheim as a figure of distinction throughout years when verified objections were raised around the world and within the U.N. itself\u201d about his war record.\n\nIn his memoir, Mr. Urquhart called Waldheim a \u201cliving lie.\u201d By \u201ccovering up\u201d his wartime service, Waldheim did \u201cimmense damage not only to his own country but to the United Nations and to those who have devoted, and in some cases sacrificed, their lives for it,\u201d Mr. Urquhart wrote.\n\nBrian Edward Urquhart was born in Bridport, England, on Feb. 28, 1919. He was a boy when his father, whom he called \u201cthe century\u2019s least successful painter,\u201d abandoned the family. He soon enrolled in an all-girls school where his mother worked as a teacher.\n\nHe showed early academic promise, mastering Latin verse at 10 and earning a scholarship to study at the elite Westminster School in London, which prepared him for his later studies at the University of Oxford\u2019s Christ Church college. At the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Urquhart cut short his education in 1939 and enlisted in the British army.\n\nHe survived various near-fatal disasters. A minesweeper he was serving in hit a mine in the Thames River. In the summer of 1942, he fell 1,200 feet into a plowed field when his parachute failed to open completely during a training exercise. He spent six months recuperating in a hospital before rejoining his unit. He later saw combat in North Africa and Sicily.\n\nAs a 25-year-old chief intelligence officer, Mr. Urquhart warned, to little avail, against Operation Market Garden: the calamitous September 1944 Allied military assault behind German lines in the Netherlands. The event was dramatized in Cornelius Ryan\u2019s 1974 nonfiction book, \u201cA Bridge Too Far,\u201d and the subsequent film version.\n\nPlanned by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Operation Market Garden aimed to seize control of several strategic bridges along the Rhine, paving the way for an Allied advance into Germany.\n\nMr. Urquhart worried that the British command had grossly underestimated the Germans\u2019 strength and ordered an air reconnaissance mission that revealed the presence of two Panzer divisions near the Allies\u2019 drop-off point.\n\nMr. Urquhart\u2019s warnings were dismissed by his British superiors. Two days before the planned attack, a medical officer recommended Mr. Urquhart be sent off on medical leave to recover from \u201cnervous exhaustion.\u201d More than 17,000 Allied forces were killed or wounded in Operation Market Garden.\n\nReflecting on the operation, Mr. Urquhart told the Times in 1982: \u201cThe worst way to make an argument is by reason and good information. You must appeal to people\u2019s emotions and to their fears of being made to look ridiculous. I also learned that if you happen, by some chance, to get something right, you become extremely unpopular.\u201d\n\nThat experience and his later participation in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp inspired Mr. Urquhart to pursue a career of peacemaking at the United Nations.\n\nAfter the war, the historian Arnold Toynbee, a family friend, wrote a recommendation for Mr. Urquhart that helped him land a job as an assistant to Gladwyn Jebb, the executive secretary for a committee charged with setting up the United Nations. He later was an adviser for Trygve Lie, the Norwegian who became the U.N.\u2019s first secretary general.\n\nMr. Urquhart\u2019s first marriage, to Alfreda Huntington, ended in divorce. In 1963, he married Sidney Damrosch Howard Canfield, a daughter of the playwright Sidney Howard and a granddaughter of composer and conductor Walter Damrosch.\n\nIn addition to his wife, survivors include three children from his first marriage, Thomas Urquhart of Falmouth, Maine, Katharine Ohno of Brighton, England, and Robert Urquhart of Denver; two children from his second marriage, Rachel Urquhart of Tyringham and Charles Urquhart of Leverett, Mass.; a stepson, Thomas Canfield of Washington; 14 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.\n\nAt the U.N., Mr. Urquhart walked a finely calibrated balance in an organization without sovereign power but that derived strength from accord between its two strongest patrons, the United States and Russia. For the duration of the Cold War, those nations were nuclear antagonists, making progress seem futile.\n\n\u201cThree-fourths of the time, you achieve nothing, but every once in a while, it works just enough to make it worthwhile going on with it,\u201d he said in 1972 in describing the political effectiveness of the U.N. \u201cFrom day to day, one thinks it hopeless, but cumulatively, it does work.\u201d"
